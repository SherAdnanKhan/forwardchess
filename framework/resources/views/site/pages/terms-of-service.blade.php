                        AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR

                        ACCESS OR VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, (B) THE INABILITY TO USE THE PRODUCT, OR (C) ANY INFORMATION, CONTENT OR ANY FORM OF DATA THAT IS INPUT,
                        IMPORTED, TRANSFERRED, TRANSMITTED TO, TRANSMITTED FROM, RECEIVED FROM OR RECEIVED BY THE PRODUCT OR ANY ACCOMPANYING SERVICES. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE

                    </p>
                    <p>13. INDEMNIFICATION. You must defend, indemnify and hold Forward Chess harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, liabilities, costs or
                        damages arising out of your use of the Product or your violation of this EULA.

                    </p>
                    <p>14. NO ASSIGNMENT. This EULA will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable against your respective successors and permitted assignees.
                        You may not assign this EULA, or any of your rights, interests, or obligations in connection with your use of the Product, without seeking and obtaining the
                        prior written consent of Forward Chess in each instance. Any such assignment without such consent will be void and of no force and effect.

                    </p>
                    <p>15. THIRD PARTY CONTENT. The Product may contain content or links to various third party web sites
                        and other resources (“<span class="bold">Third Party Content</span>“). This third party content (e.g. other than www.ForwardChess.com) is not under the
                        control of Forward Chess and Forward Chess is not responsible or liable for the content, communications or materials of any Third Party Content. Forward
                        Chess, if applicable, provides this content or links to you as a convenience only.
                        The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Forward Chess of the Third Party Content or any association with its operators. You are responsible
                        for adhering to the applicable terms of service for any Third Party Content. You are solely responsible and liable for any interactions you may have with
                        such entities, their sponsors and other third parties.

                    </p>
                    <p>16. U.S. GOVERNMENT LICENSE RIGHTS. All software provided to the U.S. Government pursuant to solicitations issued on or after December 1, 1995 is provided
                        with the commercial license rights and restrictions described in this EULA. All software provided to the U.S. Government pursuant to solicitations issued
                        prior to December 1, 1995 is provided with “Restricted Rights” as provided for in FAR, 48 CFR 52.227-14 (JUNE 1987) or DFAR, 48 CFR 252.227-7013 (OCT 1988),
                        as applicable.

                    </p>
                    <p>17. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You acknowledge that the Product contains software that is subject to U.S. export jurisdiction. You agree to comply with all
                        applicable international and national laws that apply to the Product, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, as well as end-user, end-use and
                        destination restrictions issued by U.S. and other governments. You hereby represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to
                        a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a ‘terrorist supporting’ country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S.
                        Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

                    </p>
                    <p>18. GOVERNING LAW; VENUE; ATTORNEYS’ FEES. Maine state law governs the interpretation of this EULA and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of
                        conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair
                        competition laws, and in tort. Regardless of the choice of laws, any action arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be brought in the state or
                        federal courts located in Maine, and each party irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts. If either party employs
                        attorneys to enforce any rights arising out of or relating to this EULA, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees,
                        costs and other expenses.

                    </p>
                    <p>19. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; NO WAIVER; SEVERABILITY. This EULA comprises the entire agreement and understanding of you and Forward Chess regarding the Product and
                        supersedes and replaces all other agreements or representations, whether electronic, written or oral, regarding the subject matter of this EULA. Forward
                        Chess’s failure at any time to require strict performance by you or any other licensees of any of the provisions of this EULA does not waive Forward Chess’s
                        right to thereafter require strict compliance with any provisions of this EULA. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines, in a final non-appealable
                        judgment, that any provision of this EULA is invalid, illegal, or otherwise unenforceable, such provision will be deleted and the remainder of the EULA will
                        be enforced as nearly as possible in accordance with the stated intention of the parties. Electronic images of this EULA will be considered originals.

                    </p>
                    <p>20. MODIFICATION OF THIS AGREEMENT. Forward Chess may modify this Agreement at any time in its sole discretion. If so, a change of terms notice or a current
                        version of this Agreement will be posted at the Forward Chess website (at www.ForwardChess.com). In the event of a material change to this Agreement we will
                        also use reasonable efforts to notify you by sending notice to the email address that you have provided to us. If any modification is unacceptable to you,
                        you agree that your only recourse is to immediately terminate your use of the Product and destroy any installations of the Product on your devices and in
                        your possession. Your continued use of the Product following our posting of a change of terms notice or a new end user licensing agreement on the Product
                        will constitute your binding acceptance of the change. YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT INDICATES THAT YOU GIVE CONSENT TO FORWARD CHESS TO SEND AN E-MAIL
                        COMMUNICATION TO YOU WITH NOTICES CONCERNING MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE PRODUCT(S) OR THE SERVICES TO WHICH YOU HAVE SUBSCRIBED.
