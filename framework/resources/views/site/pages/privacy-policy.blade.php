                    </p>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy describes our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of information
                        about you in connection with your use of our services,
                        including those offered through our websites, emails, and mobile applications (collectively
                        referred to herein as “the Service.”) </p>

                    <p class="title">
                        Information we collect and how we use it.
                    </p>
                    <p>We may collect and store information about you in connection with your use of the Service,
                        including any information you transmit to or through the Service.
                        We use that information to provide the Service’s functionality, fulfill your requests, improve
                        the Service’s quality, engage in research and analysis
                        relating to the Service, personalize your experience, track usage of the Service, provide
                        feedback to third party businesses that are listed on the Service,
                        display relevant advertising, market the Service, provide customer support, message you, back up
                        our systems, allow for disaster recovery, enhance the
                        security of the Service, and comply with legal obligations. Even when we do not retain such
                        information, it still must be transmitted to our servers
                        initially and stored long enough to process.
                    </p>

                    <p class="title">Account information</p>
                    <p>If you create a Forward Chess account, we may store and use the information you provide during
                        that process, such as your name, email address, and other
                        information you may provide with your account.

                    <p class="title">Transactions</p>
                    <p>If you initiate a transaction through the Service, such as the purchase of a book, the credit
                        card details submitted in order to make the payment will be
                        submitted to Paypal, Google or Apple, and not transmitted to Forward Chess. At this time Forward
                        Chess does not see, store or retain any credit card details
                        related to payments made for chess books in the application.</p>

                    <p class="title">Cookies</p>
                    <p>We may use cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, local shared objects such as HTML5 and Flash
                        (sometimes called “flash cookies”), advertising identifiers
                        (including mobile identifiers such as Apple’s IDFA or Google’s Advertising ID) and similar
                        technology (“Cookies”) in connection with your use of the
                        Service, third party websites, and mobile applications. Cookies may have unique identifiers, and
                        reside, among other places, on your computer or mobile
                        device, in emails we send to you, and on our web pages. Cookies may transmit information about
                        you and your use of the Service, such as your browser type,
                        search preferences, IP address, data relating to advertisements that have been displayed to you
                        or that you have clicked on, and the date and time of your
                        use of the Service as well as which content you viewed. Cookies may be persistent or stored only
                        during an individual session.</p>
                    <p>The purposes for which we use Cookies in the Service include:</p>

                    <ul class="list spaced">
                        <li><strong>Processes:</strong> Intended to make the Service work in the way you expect.</li>
                        <li><strong>Authentication, Security, and Compliance:</strong> Intended to prevent fraud,
                            protect your data from unauthorized parties, and comply with legal requirements.
                            For example, we use Cookies to determine if you are logged in.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Preferences:</strong> Intended to remember information about how you prefer the
                            Service to behave and look. For example, we may use a Cookie to tell us whether
                            you have declined to allow us to send push notifications to your phone.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Analytics on the desktop application:</strong> Intended to help us understand how
                            visitors use the Service. For example, we use a Cookie that tells us how our
                            search suggestions correlate to your interactions with the search page.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>You can set some Cookie preferences through your device or browser settings, but doing so may
                        affect the functionality of the Service. The method for
                        disabling Cookies may vary by device and browser, but can usually be found in your device or
                        browser preferences or security settings. For example, iOS and
                        Android devices each have settings which are designed to limit forms of ad tracking. </p>

                    <p class="title">Third parties</p>
                    <p>Investigations and Legal Disclosures: We may investigate and disclose information from or about
                        you if we have a good faith belief that such investigation or
                        disclosure: (a) is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process and law enforcement
                        instructions and orders, such as a search warrant, subpoena,
                        statute, judicial proceeding, or other legal process or law enforcement requests served on us;
                        (b) is helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible
                        wrongdoing in connection with the Service; or (c) protects our rights, reputation, property, or
                        that of our users, affiliates, or the public. </p>
                    <p>Content Partners: We have publishing and sales agreements with various third parties, however,
                        those third parties do not have direct access to the data
                        collected by the Service. From time to time, Forward Chess may choose to share some data with
                        these third parties but only in the aggregate and repsecting
                        user anonymity. For instance, we are obligated to inform these third parties how many of their
                        books have sold, but not the names or email addresses of the
                        individual purchasers. We will not share any such data without first retaining your consent to
                        do so. </p>
                    <p>Service Providers: We may rely on third party providers to support or provide some of the
                        services that are available through the Service, such as Paypal,
                        Apple and Google. We may also rely on third party providers to perform certain services for us
                        in connection with your use of the Service, such as
                        communications and hosting services, network security, technical and customer support, tracking
                        and reporting functions, quality assurance testing, payment
                        processing, our own marketing of the Service, and other functions. We may share information from
                        or about you with these third party providers so that they
                        can perform their services or complete your requests. These third party providers may share
                        information with us that they obtain from or about you in
                        connection with providing their services or completing your requests. In such cases, please note
                        that the information you provide is being provided to the
                        third party.</p>
                    <p>Links: The Service may link to third party services, like a business’s URL. Except as set forth
                        herein, we do not share your personal information with them,
                        and are not responsible for their privacy practices. We suggest you read the privacy policies on
                        or applicable to all such third party services.</p>

                    <p class="title">Security</p>
                    <p>We use various safeguards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during
                        transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of
                        transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100%
                        secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially
                        acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute
                        security.</p>

                    <p class="title">Termination</p>
                    <p>We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to the Service immediately, without prior
                        notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any
                        reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of the
                        Terms.</p>
                    <p>If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service.</p>
                    <p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive
                        termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions,
                        warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>

                    <p class="title">GDPR Compliance</p>
                    <p>You may choose to restrict the collection or use of your personal information by emailing us at

                        your personal information to send you promotional information about third parties which we think
                        you may find interesting.</p>
                    <p>If you believe that any information we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, please
                        write to or email us as soon as possible at the above address.
                        We will promptly correct any information found to be incorrect.</p>
